  - [Informational EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/informational) are non-standard improvements that do not require any form of consensus.

**Before you write an ERC, ideas MUST be thoroughly discussed on [Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/) or [Ethereum Research](https://ethresear.ch/t/read-this-before-posting/8).
Once consensus is reached, thoroughly read and review [EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1), which describes the EIP/ERC process.**

Please note that this repository is for documenting standards and not for help implementing them.
These types of inquiries should be directed to the [Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com).
For specific questions and concerns regarding ERCs, it's best to comment on the relevant discussion thread of the ERC denoted by the `discussions-to` tag in the ERC's preamble.

If you would like to become an EIP Editor, please read [EIP-5069](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5069).

## Preferred Citation Format

The canonical URL for an ERC that has achieved draft status at any point is at <https://eips.ethereum.org/>
For example, the canonical URL for EIP-1 is <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1>.

Consider any document not published at <https://eips.ethereum.org/> as a working paper
Additionally, consider published EIPs with a status of "draft", "review", or "last call" to be incomplete drafts, and note that their specification is likely to be subject to change.
